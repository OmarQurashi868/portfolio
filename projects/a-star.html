    <h1>A-star-hex-grid-2d</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/OmarQurashi868/a-star-hex-grid-2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github
        repo</a>
    <p>
        This is an implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm modified to accomodate hex-based 2D grids in the Godot
        game engine.
    </p>
    <p>
        The way that 2D grids count coordinates for hexagonal grids causes some issues because hexagonal grids have 6
        neighbors instead of 4, which means that if you connect the points that a normal grid needs you'd have 2
        disconnected points left. But at the same time if you enable all 4 diagonals you'll get 2 extra points that
        break the pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 2 disconnected points that need to be connected to the center hexagonal cell switch directions every row (or
        column for vertical offset). For even row numbers the 2 missing points are top-left and bottom-left, but for odd
        row numbers it's top-right and bottom-right. For vertical offset grids it's swapped around, for even column
        numbers the missing points are top-left and top-right, but for odd it's bottom-left and bottom-right.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have basically added a function that connects a point to its neighboring 6 points using the logic above that's
        called for each (non-solid) point.
    </p>

        The demo was built on the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot</a>
        engine which uses the GDScript language that is based on Python, the engine is completely free and open-source.
