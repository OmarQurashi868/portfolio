    <a href="https://rctgg.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website link(API not working)</a>
    <p>
        A frontend stat displayer and tracker built for Ubisoft's game, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_Champions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Roller
            Champions"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The website made calls to the then-public Ubisoft API carrying data such as game_id, user_id, API_key and such. Then calculating and formatting the received data into easy-to-understand sections.
    </p>
    <p>
        The API_key needed to be regenerated every 3 hours as it would expire by that time, forcing me to check for the API_key's validity first and regenerating a new one of it's expired.
    </p>
    <p>
        The API has since been changed, rendering the website useless as it's unable to make any calls. Moreover, Ubisoft later implemented their own tracking platform using private API calls.
