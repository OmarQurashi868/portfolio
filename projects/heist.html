    <h1>Heist</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/OmarQurashi868/heist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github repo</a>
    <p>
        This is a WIP demo recreation of an N64 game called <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conker%27s_Bad_Fur_Day" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">"Conker's bad fur day"</a>, specifically a local multiplayer mode called "Heist".
    </p>
    <p>
        The game involvs 4 players (or teams) competing to steal the most money and store it in their vaults, using
        various weapons laid throughout the map.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game was built on the <a
        href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot</a> engine which uses the GDScript language that is based on Python, the engine is completely free and open-source. Models were created using <a
        href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Blender</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Implemented so far is character movement and spawning, team and score logic, various weapons, attacking and death (with animations!), all in a simple test map inspired by the original.
