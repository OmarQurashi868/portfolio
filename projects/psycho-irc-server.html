    <p>
        A simple IRC-like chat server backend using websockets with user authentication.
    </p>
    <p>
        The backend supports fully documented user registeration and login routes with token-based authentication, where
        websocket connection requests are rejected if auth tokens are not provided or are invalid/expired. The database
        is used to store all users and valid tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
        The server was built on Express.js using Javascript with knex as the main database engine using SQLite.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unit tests are executed using the Jest framework to insure stability and compatibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        Includes a Dockerfile for building a Docker image and deploying it to the cloud with minimal configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Github actions workflows were implemented to automatically test newly pushed builds on pullrequests, as well as
        building a new Docker image on new version releases and pushing it to the Dockerhub registery automatically.
