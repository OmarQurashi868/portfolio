    <p>
        This is my first react project, it's just a simple website where you can create voting polls and share them to
        get information about what people want.
    </p>
    <p>
        The frontend was built on React using JavaScript, hosted on Vercel. The backend was using Express.js and hosted
        on Heroku. The
        database was using MongoDB. CSS was handled by CSS Modules imported by react, alongside Framermotion for
        animations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, Heroku has since discontinuted their free plan so the website can no longer connect to the
        backend (which was the only way to access the database).
